The 4Quant algorithm can help you understand the causal factors that lead to
outcomes in your business.

# Das ist ein Test

Unlike traditional data analyst work with spreadsheets and pivot tables which
offer a shallow view of your data, our proven and proprietary algorithm can
help you find answers hidden deep within your data that would otherwise remain
hidden.

All too often it isnâ€™t always clear if data analysis is even looking at the
right data and looking for answers to the right questions. Our algorithm works
in both a supervised and unsupervised mode and can detect patterns in data that
are missed by even the most seasoned data scientists. We explore your data
using our unbiased, objective algorithm and our modeling process allows us to
converge on answers quickly and with predictable accuracy.

4Quant excels at heterogeneous, time-series, multi-variate data. These complicated data sets,
such as those that exist in a hospital, are often impossible to model.

allow you to adjust protocols and procedures to improve both clinical and
financial outcomes.
